## Parkinson's Disease Detection Using Machine Learning and SVM

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to detect Parkinson's disease based on biomedical voice measurements. The primary algorithm employed is the Support Vector Machine (SVM), which is known for its effectiveness in classification tasks.

### Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Includes normalization, handling missing values, and feature extraction.
- **Model Training:** Utilizes SVM for classification, optimized with techniques such as grid search for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Evaluation:** Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate the model.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various biomedical voice measurements from patients with Parkinson's disease and healthy individuals. It includes attributes such as MDVP (Microphone Dynamic Voice Profile) parameters, jitter, shimmer, and more.

### How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/parkinsons-disease-detection.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the Model:**
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

### Results
The SVM model achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between Parkinson's disease patients and healthy individuals, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in medical diagnostics.
